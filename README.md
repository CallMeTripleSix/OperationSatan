# OperationSatan
In progress, please be patient as I begin to upload documents, photos, findings, evidence, conversations, etc.
-- I've added some photos that I think will help paint the picture of ROOT & SAM. I will be providing more as well as adding code etc 
For clarification, Sam was the Developer for Decore. I believe that he has worked on multiple projects to include Decraft, KORE a few unknown projects & now ROOTKITFINANCE.
On the DECORE project the Developer talked and acted the same as the Developer for the Rootkit project. The ways that they message are very similar. Brief, offhandish & dismissive. They never have real genuine answers for anything.
The similiaraties between DECORE, KORE, DECRAFT & ROOT are endless. Looking at the graphs, the conversations, the web dedesigns, etc. Sam the Dev is known to be in the UK & does not care about rugging, abandonding projects, etc.
In DCORE I observed the Dev attempting to support the falling price by pausing the selling & then blaming it on something to do with a feed distributor and blaming it on further vault problems. Scammers.
